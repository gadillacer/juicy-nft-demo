This is a React app using Biconomy SDK for testing Smart Contract Wallet. The goal is to enhance user experience

### Run
1. clone
2. yarn install
3. yarn start

### NOTE
If you want to use NFT-pay later on Jucci:
1. You should connect with Web3 wallet(metamask,...) not social login. 
2. Then click "mint to EOA" instead of "mint NFT"

*** In anyscase if you got AA21 error, follow this step: ***
**Transfer Mumbai $MATIC (~0.1) to your smart contract address**

### Features
1. Social-Login
2. Gasless
3. Batch Transactions (WIP)

Expect bugs because the SDk is still in the development. Maybe replace with other SDK in the future!
